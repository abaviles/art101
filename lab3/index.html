			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge if this lab is to recognize the fie structure and how to navigate within the directories.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some small issues were just keeping track of which directory I was in when linking it to other files. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>While initially challenging, once I was able to keep track of everything, the rest of the lab went smoothly. </p>
