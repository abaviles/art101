			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding & Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenege in this lab was to practice getting into the habit of pseudocoding to draft out everything before diving straight into the process.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem I dealt with was basically trying to figure out how to elaborate on the steps we made for task 2 in order for it to have an actual function that can be coded.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I will say this lab did require a bit more thought seeing as this would be the first step into actual programming. It wasn't too stressful, yet it did challenge us a little bit which is good.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div class="minor-section">
						<h2>Task 1: Everyday Task </h2>
			
						<h3>Making Eggo Waffles:<br><br>
							1. Buy Eggo waffles, syrup and butter from store.<br>
							2. Take 2 Eggo waffles out of packaging.<br>
							3. Put Eggos in toaster.<br>
							4. Wait for them to toast.<br>
							5. Put them on a plate. <br>
							6. Add butter and syrup. <br>
							</h3>
					</div>
			
					<div class="minor-section">
						<h2>Task 2: Computer Game Pseudocode</h2>
			
						<h3>Creating Rock Paper Scissors:<br><br>
							1. Have player input Rock, Paper or Scissors. <br>
							2. Have computer make their move. <br>
							3. Compare responses between Player and Computer. <br>
							4. Create win or loss condition. <br>
							5. Repeat
						</h3>
						</div>

					<div class="minor-section">
						<h2>Task 3: Javascript Pseudocode</h2>
						<pre><code>
							/* 
1. Have player input Rock, Paper or Scissors. 
       Provide a interactive buttons for Rock, Paper or Scissors.
          Assign a variable for the player's choice.

2. Have computer make their move. 
      Computer randomly chooses from an array of strings saying "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors"
          Assign a variable for the computer's choice.

3. Compare responses between Player and Computer.
      Run through every choice and compare.
          If player chooses rock and computer chooses paper
              return "You Lose"
          If player chooses rock and computer chooses Scissors
              return "You Win"
