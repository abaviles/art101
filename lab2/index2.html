            <p>Jasmine is a 3rd art major from Virginia and new to programming similar to myself. 
                She enjoys crocheting, zumba as well as painting and watching commentary videos on YouTube.  
                For me, I am a 3rd year AGPM major from San Jose. I enjoy editing photos, creating illustrations 
                as well as drinking coffee (specifically mint mojitos) when I have the time.
